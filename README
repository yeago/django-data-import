BASIC STEPS:

1) Create a new project (or at least a clean project database)

2) Create a 'conversion' directory and inside it an __init__.py

3) Copy your legacy tables into your new database. Delete any unwanted
tables and fields and conduct any purely SQL prep-work to simplify 
things later on

4) Output the results of inspectdb to conversion/legacy_models.py:

>>>python manage.py inspectdb > conversion/legacy_models.py

5) Create conversion/imports.py and establish your conversion objects

6) Run your conversions:

>>>python manage.py convert ClassName
